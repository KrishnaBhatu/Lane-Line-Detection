# Lane-Line-Detection
## This project covers the following
* Finding lines by wrapping image to birds eye view and thresholding the image
* Finding bottom 2 points for the 2 lanes by histogram and filtering uncertanties by Kalman filter
* Finding all points in the lane using sliding window and finding 2nd degree polynomial equation of lane lines using these points
* Find the radius of curvature and turn direction
